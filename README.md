# Events App

Next.js React Framework Course â€“ Build and Deploy a Full Stack App from scratch <br />
It's a practice project referencing freeCodeCamp

In `'/'` and `'/events'` route, events are categorized by city. Then each city is associated with a dynamic route for the events of that city. Every single event has their own individual route with options for email registration. No database has been used. Data are stored in `data.json` file. Api route `'/api/email-registration'` has been created to handle email registration from single event page. There is a static `'/about-us'` route where the page is filled with dummy data.

The project is less focused in styles. It's mainly for the purpose of understanding what `Next.js` offers and how to build a full stack app with the framework. It tackles the concepts - routing system, api route, getStaticProps, getStaticPaths, getServerSideProps etc.

Technologies:

-   `Next.js`
-   `Sass`
